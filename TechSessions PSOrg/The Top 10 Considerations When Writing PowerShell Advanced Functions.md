There are lots of things to consider when writing an advanced function in PowerShell depending on what the function will be designed to accomplish, what operating system and PowerShell versions it will be written for, and who will be using it. During this session, PowerShell MVP Mike F Robbins will walk you through the top 10 items that he takes into consideration along with his thought process when creating advanced functions in PowerShell. We’ll briefly discuss comment based help, parameters, parameter validation, pipeline input, and error handling.

Prior experience with PowerShell is recommended
