PowerShell Summit videos are recorded on a "best effort" basis. We use a room mic to capture as much room audio as possible, with an emphasis on capturing the speaker. Our recordings are made in a way that minimizes overhead for our speakers and interruptions to our live audience. These recordings are meant to preserve the presentations' information for posterity, and are not intended to be a substitute for attending the Summit in person. These recordings are not intended as professional video training products. We hope you find these videos useful - the equipment used to record these was purchased using generous donations from members of the PowerShell community.
