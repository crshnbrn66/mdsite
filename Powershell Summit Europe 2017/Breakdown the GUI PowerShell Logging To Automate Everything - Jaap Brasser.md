The GUI, calling it our mortal enemy would probably be a bit too far. There are some obvious use-cases in which using a GUI to discover new functionality and to get acquainted to a new product would be a solid approach. In this session we will do exactly that, we will setup a number of different components on a server while using PowerShell logging to record what is happening on the background. We will analyze these logs and retrieve a step-by-step playbook to reproduce the configuration.
Speaker: Jaap Brasser

Slides and demo code for this and other sessions will be released on https://github.com/psconfeu/2017 over the next few weeks.
