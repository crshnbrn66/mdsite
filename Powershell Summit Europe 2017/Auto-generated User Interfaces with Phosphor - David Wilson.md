In this session we’ll be discussing a new PowerShell module project codenamed 'Phosphor' which aims to provide desktop and web user interfaces generated from PowerShell modules.  We’ll discuss the overall goals and approach with an early demo of what we’ve accomplished so far.  We’ll also discuss how you can get involved in the code!
Speaker: David Wilson

Slides and demo code for this and other sessions will be released on https://github.com/psconfeu/2017 over the next few weeks.
