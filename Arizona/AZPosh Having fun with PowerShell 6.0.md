Having fun with PowerShell 6.0 – JEA, remoting and cross-
platform
With the recent release of PowerShell 6.0 a lot of questions about remoting, using it across different platforms and what the implications are for JEA. In this session we will briefly go over these core concepts before diving into what PowerShell 6.0 brings to the table and what we are going to pay attention to in the future.
If you are already working with PowerShell 6.0 and you have specific questions be sure to have them prepared, as Yaap will be more than happy to go beyond the content covered in this session.
