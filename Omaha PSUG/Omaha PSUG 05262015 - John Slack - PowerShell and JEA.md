John Slack joins us to talk about the Just Enough Administration (JEA) Toolkit.

What is JEA?  JEA is delivered by using the built-in capabilities of the Windows PowerShell scripting environment and provides standardized methods of constructing an operator experience that can reduce access with a higher level of granularity than was available in traditional access control models.

JEA accomplishes all this by allowing specific users to perform designated administrative tasks on certain servers without giving them administrator rights, and then auditing all actions that these users performed. JEA is based on Windows PowerShell constrained run spaces, a technology that is already being used to secure administrative tasks in environments such as Microsoft Exchange Online.

John Slack is a Program Manager on the PowerShell Team.  He joined the team in 2013 after graduating from Rice University with a BS in Electrical Engineering.  Over the past two years, he has primarily worked on the PowerShell Gallery and Just Enough Administration (JEA)
