Join us this month as Omaha’s own Boe Prox (@proxb) talks about testing your PowerShell code with Pester!  Pester is an open source project on GitHub which provides a framework for running Unit Tests to execute and validate PowerShell commands inside of PowerShell. Pester tests can execute any command or script that is accessible to a pester test file. This can include functions, Cmdlets, Modules and scripts. Pester can be run in ad hoc style in a console or it can be integrated into the Build scripts of a Continuous Integration system.
