This is the replacement session delivered by Richard Siddaway for Jaap Brasser dealing with CIM, OMI, and WMI. Original abstract:
In this session Jaap will discuss some of the different methods of querying remote systems for information as well as the performance and security considerations of each approach. From there on Jaap will show how parallelize queries and how to reduce the workload on both the local as well as the remote system. The session will go beyond querying from there on and show how to manage systems complete with demos.
