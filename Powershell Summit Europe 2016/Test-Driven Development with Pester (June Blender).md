Pester is an excellent tool, but its value depends on using it to its fullest potential. It's designed for test-driven development, but few people use it that way.
In this Pester deep-dive, June introduces the concept of test-driven development, shows how to implement these concepts in a scalable process, and runs through several real-world scenarios using PowerShell Help as a specification and test generator, and Pester in its most powerful mode as a test-driven development tool.
We'll also visit the PowerShell.org Community Build Server and learn how to set up automated continuous Pester testing of open-source projects. You'll leave with a clear sense of the value of this discipline and its benefits for large- and small-scale professional PowerShell development.
